## Task

Build a fully functioning  web application using a Rails API Backend, React JS Frontend. Web application should have sign up, log-in, and log-out functionality, as well as, a create, read, update, and delete methods.  

## Criteria 

The guidelines here are minimal but be sure that you:

- Use a Rails API backend with a separate React frontend that are created in two different Github repositories.
- Have at least three resources (three DB tables) on the backend and your application must have full CRUD actions for at least one resource.
- Your application must have authentication/authorization.

### Functionality

• BizTracker is a HTML/CSS/JS frontend with a Rails API backend
• All interactions between the client and the server were handled asynchronously (AJAX) and using JSON as
  the communication format
• This web application was built with sign up, log-in, and log-out functionality
• With full CRUD capability the user can add, update, and delete any KPI graph needed for their business’s
  operation

### Summary 

I chose to build BizTracker because I wanted the opportunity to think critically about one of the major needs of SAAS businesses which is to track their performance. I selected some the most frequently used KPIs and gave the user the ability to add data and display the data that has been added to the dashboard.  This gives a business owner a centralized location where they can view their KPIs and make strategic operational decisions moving forward. The direction for the UI was to make the graphs pop so none of the critical data is overlooked.
